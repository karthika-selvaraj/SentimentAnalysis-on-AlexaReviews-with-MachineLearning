## Sentiment Analysis on Alexa reviews with Machine learning
Sentiment analysis on product reviews be a good way to know what customers think about their products. 
In this work, I did sentiment analysis on Amazon's alexa product reviews and then I create a machine learning model to classify reviews into positive review and negative review.
#### Works done in Sentiment analysis phase :
- Tokenizing reviews
- Removing punctuations from reviews
- Removing digits from reviews
- Removing stop words
- Lemmatizing reviews

#### Classifying reviews
- After getting cleaned reviews from sentiment analysis phase, I did exploratory data analysis to know what is happening inside the dataset, then I also did feature engineering on the dataset.
- Then I built a classification model with the accuracy of 92%.
